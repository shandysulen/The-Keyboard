# The Keyboard

Inspired by Wes Bos's [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/), [The Keyboard](https://thekeyboard.io) is a minimal music production and visualizer desktop web application that utlizes the computer keyboard to create beats with a default set of kits and provides visual accompaniment to the music masterpieces created. Visual customization is supported and promoted through a settings feature that allows the user to tailor the experience.

## Getting Started

Part of the planned challenge of developing this application was avoiding any use of libraries and frameworks. *That's right: I'm talking __vanillaJS.__* As a result, no major setup environment is required to be set up. Simply open up your favorite text editor and browser developer tools to begin adding on to this application.
